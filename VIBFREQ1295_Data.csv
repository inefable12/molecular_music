abstract = {The infrared spectra of aluminium chloride vapour (Al2Cl6 and AlCl3) including Al 235Cl6 and Al 237Cl6 at 473–843 K were measured in the region 700–50 cm_1 with an evacuable Fourier transform spectrometer by transmission and emission techniques. Evacuable cells of nickel were employed having windows of type IIa diamond and sealed with gold O_rings. Raman spectra of Al2Cl6 vapour at ca 500 K and of AlCl3 at 1075 K with pressures from 0.3 to 10 atm were recorded, polarization measurements were carried out and additional spectra of the 35Cl and 37Cl compounds were obtained. The dimer spectra were interpreted in terms of D2h symmetry. All the nine Raman_active and seven of the infrared_active dimer fundamentals were assigned. The IR active mode $\nu$10(B1u), expected below 40 cm_1, and the inactive mode $\nu$5(Au) were left unassigned. The monomer spectra were interpreted in terms of D3h symmetry and all four fundamentals were assigned. A dimer force field, involving 12 independent force constants, was derived. The calculated frequencies were fitted with a least_squares programme to 30 observed fundamentals of Al 235Cl6 and Al 237Cl6 and 14 additional isotopic shifts transferred from previous matrix isolation spectra. A complete force field for the monomer was derived, using the four observed fundamentals and seven isotopic shifts transferred from previously reported matrix isolation spectra.

The rotational structures of 10 fundamental bands (four of a-type, three of b-type and three of c-type) have been analysed using the Watson model. Ground state rotational and quartic centrifugal distortion constants as well as upper state spectroscopic constants have been obtained from the fits. A number of perturbations have been identified in the bands. From a local crossing observed in $\nu$15 we located the very weak $\nu$14 band at 858.19(1) cm-1. Also $\nu$13 is definitively located at 899.3 cm-1. The three global c-Coriolis interacting dyads $\nu$9/$\nu$10, $\nu$10/$\nu$11, and $\nu$12/$\nu$13 have each been analysed by a model including first and second order Coriolis resonance using ab initio predicted first order Coriolis coupling constants; second order Coriolis interaction parameters are determined. The rotational constants, harmonic and anharmonic frequencies, intensities, and vibration-rotation constants (alphas, $\alpha$$\nu$A, B, C) have been predicted by quantum chemical calculations using a cc-pVTZ basis at the MP2 and B3LYP methodology levels, and compared with the present experimental data. Both the rotational constants and frequencies are marginally closer to experiment from the B3LYP calculations. In order to make more significant comparisons between theory and experiment for the alphas, we take differences between ground and vibronic state values; under these circumstances, the B3LYP definitely have a closer fit to experiment. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The high-resolution infrared spectrum of cyclopropane (C3H6) has been measured from 100 cm-1 to 2200 cm-1. In that region we have identified 24 absorption bands attributed to six fundamental bands, five combination bands, three hot bands and 10 difference bands. Long pathlength spectra, up to 32 m, facilitated the identification and analysis of many previously unstudied infrared inactive, and Raman and infrared inactive vibrational states, including direct access to two forbidden fundamental states, $\nu$4 and $\nu$14. An improved set of constants for the ground vibrational state as well as for the fundamental vibrations $\nu$7, $\nu$9, $\nu$10, $\nu$11 are also reported. The spectral resolution of the measurements varied from 0.002 cm-1 to 0.004 cm-1. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

The mode coupling is manifested in the spectrum as two overlapping vibrational bands. Each of these two bands are well modeled by an asymmetric top/rigid rotor Hamiltonian. The lack of any angular momentum dependence on the coupling indicates that the vibrations are coupled by an anharmonic mechanism.

We have performed the vibrational assignment of the vibration-rotation bands observed between 500 and 12,000 cm-1 for pyrrole, and 500 and 9000 cm-1 for furan. The assignment of the fundamental bands is supported by ab initio calculations at the MP2 level of approximation, considering both band positions and absolute absorption intensities. These calculations also allowed the normal mode coordinates to be drawn for the two species and their geometrical structure to be calculated. Vibrational mode numbering and symmetries are updated to latest conventions in the literature. In the combination and overtone spectral ranges, the band shape information guided the assignment, which could be achieved for most of the numerous observed bands. An extensive set of vibration constants was obtained for each species. The results from the literature available on each species are considered at each step of the investigation. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Diode-laser (DL) spectroscopy in a supersonic jet was used to record some portions of the band at Lille, revealing the fine structure around the band center. Pure rotation (MMW) data in the upper state were also recorded at Lille. Some 5559 FT, 101 DL, and 23 MMW data were assigned in this work. We fitted, on one hand, the MMW and DL data together and, on the other hand, the MMW, DL, and FT data simultaneously using a weighted procedure, constraining the ground state constants to their value determined from the microwave data in the literature. The results from these fits are provided and the constants discussed. Ab initio calculations are also performed to provide a force field which is used to support the very strong increase with the vibrational excitation observed in the inertial defect determined from the experimental rotational constants. {\textcopyright} 1999 Academic Press.},

The molecular parameters were determined from the observed line positions and the available microwave data by least-squares-fits using Watson's A-reduced Hamiltonian. Some relations among parameters appearing in different formulations of the Hamiltonian are represented explicitly in connection with the derivation of the unreduced constants. The unreduced constants were derived for both molecules using the planarity relations. We determined the inertial defects to be ≈ 0.05 amu {\AA}2 in the ground state and ≈ _0.2 amu {\AA}2 in the excited state for both furane and thiophene. {\textcopyright} 1993, Walter de Gruyter.

A total of 9103 lines were assigned and included in a simultaneous fit of all three bands.

Vibrational mode numbering and symmetries are updated to latest conventions in the literature. In the combination and overtone spectral ranges, the band shape information guided the assignment, which could be achieved for most of the numerous observed bands. An extensive set of vibration constants was obtained for each species. The results from the literature available on each species are considered at each step of the investigation. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We have recorded the infrared absorption spectrum of pyrrole at 0.005 cm-1 spectral resolution using a Fourier transform interferometer. The rotational analysis of the symmetric out-of-plane C-H bend 2201 fundamental band at 722.132993(5) cm-1 was performed, allowing 6760 lines to be assigned. These lines were fitted simultaneously to literature data on $\nu$1 [A. Mellouki, R. Georges, M. Herman, D. L. Snavely, and S. Leytner, Chem. Phys. 220, 311-322 (1997)] and microwave lines [G. Wlodarczak, L. Martinache, J. Demaison, and B. P. Van Eijck, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 127, 200-208 (1988)]. A set of rotation parameters was determined for the ground state in Ir and IIIr representations, together with vibration-rotation constants for the $\nu$1 = 1 and $\nu$22 = 1 vibrational states. The fine structure in the strongest of the hot bands in that range was highlighted by division, from the experimental data, of the spectrum of the 2201 band, computed using the vibration-rotation parameters. The rotational assignment of 930 lines in the strongest hot band was performed. The 22012411 vibrational assignment is proposed, leading to x22,24 = 1.90 cm-1. The transition dipole matrix element for the 2201 band is estimated to |_$\psi$22|$\mu$c|$\psi$0_| = 2 _ 10-4 D. {\textcopyright} 1999 Academic Press.},

Raman polarization measurements are newly given for some 70 lines between 1600 and 3000 cm-1. The Kakiuti et al. (Kakiuti et al., J. Mol. Spectrosc. 61 (1976) 164) assignment for the nonplanar modes in CS2 solution is shown to be the only previous correct assignment. Planar assignment modifications, though generally small, are warranted because of the benchmark nature of pyridine. A previous set of vibrational frequencies, derived from a scaled 4-21G force field calculation (Pongor et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 106 (1984) 2765; Pongor et al., J. Mol. Spectrosc. 114 (1985) 445), is in excellent agreement with the observed fundamentals, and in fact, tips the balance in favor of assigning v22 to 1053 cm-1. Ideal-gas entropies derived from spectroscopic constants are also seen to be in excellent agreement with those from calorimetry (Chirico et al., J. Chem. Thermodyn. 28 (1996) 797; Chirico and Steele, J. Chem. Thermodyn. 28 (1996) 819). {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Extensive rotational structure was recorded for the $\nu$1, $\nu$2, and $\nu$41 bands of C2H2 and C2D2 and the $\nu$1 and $\nu$2 bands of C2HD; Q branches only were obtained for the $\nu$31 band of C2HD and the 2$\nu$40 band of C2D2. The rotational structures were computer-analyzed to yield values of $\nu$0, B1, D1, and q, the infrared value of B0 being assumed. From the Q branches of hot bands certain anharmonicity constants xij could be obtained. A combination of infrared and Raman data, which best satisfied a consistency test, was used to obtain the equilibrium bond lengths, re(CH) = re(CD) = 1.0605 ± 3 A__ and re(CC) = 1.2033 ± 2 A__. {\textcopyright} 1972.},

Unperturbed values are derived for the energy and intensity parameters by treating the Fermi-type resonance and k-doubling effects involved through the interaction with the $\nu$2 + $\nu$4 + $\nu$5 level. The complete set of k-components is included in the procedure. Fitting procedures are carried our on the line energies, the line intensities, and both sets of information simultaneously. The main results are, for the deperturbed values: E($\nu$3) = 3288.58075(13) cm-1, E($\nu$2 + $\nu$4 + $\nu$5) = 3296.79650(9)cm-1, k2345 = 25.86749(13) cm-1, and the transition moments Rv($\nu$3) = ±0.08907(3) D and Rv($\nu$2 + $\nu$4 + $\nu$5) = _2.63(3) _ 10-3 D. with the errors (1$\sigma$) quoted on the last digits.

abstract = {The four A1-species fundamentals of ketene have been analyzed at a resolution of 0.05 cm-1. Assignments are made for J ≤ 36 and Ka ≤ 7, and asymmetry splittings observed for Ka ≤ 2. Although individual subband analyses can be made, yielding upper state B, C, and B constants, all four bands exhibit irregular subband origins such that in no case can an accurate vibrational origin be determined. The rather close-lying perturbing levels can almost certainly be identified but no strictly quantitative interpretation of the perturbations can be made. Studies of the spectra of H213C12CO and H212C13CO confirm the origin of these perturbations. They are particularly acute in the cases of $\nu$3 (_ 1387 cm-1), in Fermi resonance with $\nu$8 + $\nu$9, and of $\nu$4 (_ 1116 cm-1), in Fermi resonance with $\nu$5 + $\nu$6, and also 2$\nu$5 and 2$\nu$6. Indeed, in the latter case, it is debatable whether the observed band should be called $\nu$4 at all. On the other hand, analyses of the 2$\nu$8 overtones of the CH2 rocking fundamentals in the isotopic ketenes show little evidence of the effects of vibrational perturbations. The four fundamentals of dideuteroketene have also been studied; only $\nu$1 would appear to be essentially unperturbed. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {The general harmonic force field (GHFF) of ketene has been determined through a joint empirical-ab initio investigation. Perturbations in the infrared spectra of all isotopic species render experimental frequency data of limited discriminatory value in the empirical determination. Microwave/infrared determined quartic distortion constants are found to be mutually incompatible, both within and between isotopic species. The sensitivity of the distortion constants to truncation and constraints made in their determination is established in order to make a realistic estimate of their reliability in the force constant calculations. Ab initio calculations performed at various different levels of sophistication predict consistent values for interaction constants, some of which are markedly different from previously reported empirical values. The joint empirical-ab initio GHFF reproduces all observed and perturbation-corrected data well over five isotopic species. Coriolis interaction constants are calculated for ketene-H2, -HD, and -D2, which will be of assistance to future analyses, particularly of the strongly interacting four-level systems below 1000 cm-1. Scaled ab initio force constants, calculated around the experimental ground state geometry as reference, are in excellent agreement with the empirical values, with one exception, which arises due to neglect of configuration interaction. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {The four A1-species fundamentals of ketene have been analyzed at a resolution of 0.05 cm-1. Assignments are made for J ≤ 36 and Ka ≤ 7, and asymmetry splittings observed for Ka ≤ 2. Although individual subband analyses can be made, yielding upper state B, C, and B constants, all four bands exhibit irregular subband origins such that in no case can an accurate vibrational origin be determined. The rather close-lying perturbing levels can almost certainly be identified but no strictly quantitative interpretation of the perturbations can be made. Studies of the spectra of H213C12CO and H212C13CO confirm the origin of these perturbations. They are particularly acute in the cases of $\nu$3 (_ 1387 cm-1), in Fermi resonance with $\nu$8 + $\nu$9, and of $\nu$4 (_ 1116 cm-1), in Fermi resonance with $\nu$5 + $\nu$6, and also 2$\nu$5 and 2$\nu$6. Indeed, in the latter case, it is debatable whether the observed band should be called $\nu$4 at all. On the other hand, analyses of the 2$\nu$8 overtones of the CH2 rocking fundamentals in the isotopic ketenes show little evidence of the effects of vibrational perturbations. The four fundamentals of dideuteroketene have also been studied; only $\nu$1 would appear to be essentially unperturbed. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {Infrared and Raman spectra of the v1 band of ketene, H 2CCO, have been recorded at Doppler resolution. The infrared spectrum has been obtained with a difference frequency infrared spectrometer, and the Raman spectrum of the Q branches of this band has been recorded using a stimulated Raman spectrometer. The vib-rotational analysis of the data is very complicated because of many crossings with other vibrational states, which can interact with v1=1 through Fermi or Coriolis mechanisms. We present a discussion on global and local resonances, and we are able to extract information on the perturbing levels and on the perturbation parameters, even though the perturbing bands are not always detected in the spectrum. {\textcopyright} 1994 American Institute of Physics.},

The ground state combination differences obtained from the infrared spectrum together with the microwave and the new millimeterwave transitions have been used to determine a complete set of ground state rotational and centrifugal distortion constants.

The $\nu$4 band was measured between 900 and 990 cm-1 with a resolution of 0.006 cm-1; 971 transitions were assigned to the P and R branches of the $\nu$4 fundamental band spanning K = 0 to K = 9 and J = 0 to J = 65. Reliable and highly accurate sets of spectroscopic constants for both of the $\nu$4 and ground states were generated. Small anomalies were found in a group of lines in the low-J region of the K = 4 subband and near J = 61 of the K = 3 subband. A perturbation analysis was performed based on symmetry considerations. A rotational resonance ($\Delta$l = _ 1, $\Delta$k = ±2) between the $\nu$4 and 3$\nu$8±1 (kl < 0) was found to be the most probable origin of the anomalies, and the interaction matrix element has been derived. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

The methyl rock and the in-phase C-C-F stretch are strongly mixed in CD3CFO (839 and 778 cm-1).

abstract = {Infrared spectra of acetyl fluoride and acetyl fluoride-d3 are reported for the gas and the solid, as are the Raman spectra of the liquids. Changes in a previous assignment for CH3CFO [J. Chem. Phys. 53, 1713 (1970)] are indicated. Observed intensities and analogy with COF2 suggest that fundamentals at 826 and 1188 cm-1 are best described as in-phase and out-of-phase C-C-F stretches. The methyl rock and the in-phase C-C-F stretch are strongly mixed in CD3CFO (839 and 778 cm-1). A product-rule calculation indicates that the fundamental frequencies of CD3CFO are about 2 per cent higher than expected on the basis of a strictly harmonic potential function for CH3CPO. A similar calculation is used to compare CH3CFO with CF3CFO. {\textcopyright} 1972.},

abstract = {Infrared spectra from 4000 to 400 cm-1 of crystalline films and gases of CH3CHO, CH3CDO, CD3CHO, CD3CDO and CH2DCHO have been measured with spectral slit width ≥ 0.4 cm-1. For the crystal spectra, factor group splittings were observed and identified by studying isotopically mixed crystals. In the gas spectra, the Q-branch structure of many bands were resolved. A nearly complete assignment, differing considerably from former work, of the fundamentals of CH3CHO, CH3CDO, CD3CHO and CD3CDO is based on a comparison of computed and observed rotational contours. The rotational structure of several bands reveal a Coriolis type coupling between nearly degenerate a' and a_ fundamentals, which is qualitatively discussed. Furthermore, some strong Fermi resonances of combination tones involving the torsional mode with fundamentals are found for the gas spectra. In the crystal spectra these resonances are lifted, the reason being a shift of the methyl torsion by 50-60 cm-1, caused by the crystal field. From a normal coordinate analysis, a fairly general harmonic valence force field and additional information about the assignments have been obtained. The RMS deviation of calculated and observed fundamental frequencies was about 7 cm-1. This is considered as a lower limit attainable by harmonic approximation. The normal coordinate analysis is also used to get a nearly complete assignment of the highly complex spectra of both the symmetric and gauche isomers of CH2DCHO. {\textcopyright} 1971.},

abstract = {Infrared spectra from 4000 to 400 cm-1 of crystalline films and gases of CH3CHO, CH3CDO, CD3CHO, CD3CDO and CH2DCHO have been measured with spectral slit width ≥ 0.4 cm-1. For the crystal spectra, factor group splittings were observed and identified by studying isotopically mixed crystals. In the gas spectra, the Q-branch structure of many bands were resolved. A nearly complete assignment, differing considerably from former work, of the fundamentals of CH3CHO, CH3CDO, CD3CHO and CD3CDO is based on a comparison of computed and observed rotational contours. The rotational structure of several bands reveal a Coriolis type coupling between nearly degenerate a' and a_ fundamentals, which is qualitatively discussed. Furthermore, some strong Fermi resonances of combination tones involving the torsional mode with fundamentals are found for the gas spectra. In the crystal spectra these resonances are lifted, the reason being a shift of the methyl torsion by 50-60 cm-1, caused by the crystal field. From a normal coordinate analysis, a fairly general harmonic valence force field and additional information about the assignments have been obtained. The RMS deviation of calculated and observed fundamental frequencies was about 7 cm-1. This is considered as a lower limit attainable by harmonic approximation. The normal coordinate analysis is also used to get a nearly complete assignment of the highly complex spectra of both the symmetric and gauche isomers of CH2DCHO. {\textcopyright} 1971.},

abstract = {The mid-IR and near-IR vapor phase spectrum of CH 3COOH was examined with a focus on the regions of the $\nu$ 17 O-H torsion and the $\nu$ 1 O-H stretch. Each region showed a number of peaks that were assigned using previous ab initio work, their temperature dependence, and analysis of the deuterated species of acetic acid (CD 3COOH, CH 3COOD, and CD 3COOD). These assignments correct and improve upon the values currently used in the literature. Many of the peaks were assigned as hot bands associated with either the $\nu$ 17 O-H torsion or the $\nu$ 1 O-H stretch. In addition, the first definitive assignment of the Q-branch of the $\nu$ 1 O-H stretch was made. The hot bands were shown to contribute a significant amount of absorption intensity to the $\nu$ 1 region at 298 K. An empirical temperature-dependent correction to the total absorption of the $\nu$ 1 O-H stretching region as well as an adjusted absolute cross-section for $\nu$ 1 are given and suggested for future use. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A high resolution Fourier transform infrared spectrum of C 2H 6, measured at a pressure of 173.3Pa and an optical path of 153.2m, was analysed between 1050 and 1295cm -1. Extensive absorption due to the difference bands v 11-v 4, and several rotation-torsion lines of the difference band v 2-v 4, in the region of the x, y-Coriolis resonance of v 2 and v 11, were observed. This allowed a detailed rotation-torsion analysis of the upper states v 11 and v 2. The anomalous torsional structure, found in the non-degenerate vibrational state v 2, can be explained as the effect of an Hamiltonian term accounting for a strong dependence of the torsional barrier height on the normal vibrational coordinate q 2. The value of the barrier height derivative @V 3/@q 2 is estimated to be 127 ± 10cm -1. Also detected and assigned were 'hot' difference transitions belonging to the (v 4+ v 11)-2v 4 band, yielding information on the upper state v 4 + v 11. It is believed that transitions from 3v 4 to 2v 4 + v 11 are also detectable in the investigated region. {\textcopyright} 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The Fourier transform infrared spectrum of ethane between 2860 and 3060 cm-1 has been re-investigated under high resolution at 229 K. The infrared absorption in this region is due mainly to the CH stretching fundamentals $\nu$5 (parallel band) and $\nu$7 (degenerate perpendicular band), and to the parallel combination system $\nu$8 + $\nu$11 (A4s, A3s). All the relevant perturbation mechanisms affecting the observed absorption patterns have been clarified. In particular, the main perturbers of the $\nu$7 state are identified to be the degenerate vibrational combination states $\nu$8 + $\nu$11 (l-type interaction) and $\nu$3 + 2$\nu$4 + $\nu$8 (Fermi-type interaction). Because of the last interaction, the K_$\Delta$K = -6 transitions occur with intensities comparable to both the infrared active fundamental $\nu$7 and the almost dark combination $\nu$3 + 2$\nu$4 + $\nu$8. The parallel combination system $\nu$8 + $\nu$11 (A 4s, A3s) is overlapped and heavily perturbed by the nearby parallel system $\nu$4 + $\nu$11 + $\nu$12 (A4s, A3s), whose K-structure is spread by the strong z-Coriolis interaction of its two vibrational components. In this work, 95 new transitions to the perturbers of $\nu$7 have been assigned. They belong mostly to the degenerate vibrational states $\nu$8 + $\nu$11 (E1d) and $\nu$3 + 2$\nu$4 + $\nu$8 (E1d), and to the parallel system $\nu$8 + $\nu$11 (A4s, A3s). A least squares fit calculation, limited to the $\nu$7 degenerate fundamental and its degenerate perturbers $\nu$8 + $\nu$11, $\nu$3 + 2$\nu$4 + $\nu$8, $\nu$4 + $\nu$11 + $\nu$12, and $\nu$3 + 3$\nu$4 + $\nu$12 was performed. From the results of this fit, we created a line-by-line database containing the molecular parameters for 4969 transitions in these five bands of 12C2H6. Finally, we identified the degenerate combination band $\nu$2 + $\nu$8 (62 observed transitions) to be the main perturber (x, y-Coriolis-type interaction) of the parallel fundamental $\nu$5. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The Fourier transform infrared spectrum of ethane between 2860 and 3060 cm-1 has been re-investigated under high resolution at 229 K. The infrared absorption in this region is due mainly to the CH stretching fundamentals $\nu$5 (parallel band) and $\nu$7 (degenerate perpendicular band), and to the parallel combination system $\nu$8 + $\nu$11 (A4s, A3s). All the relevant perturbation mechanisms affecting the observed absorption patterns have been clarified. In particular, the main perturbers of the $\nu$7 state are identified to be the degenerate vibrational combination states $\nu$8 + $\nu$11 (l-type interaction) and $\nu$3 + 2$\nu$4 + $\nu$8 (Fermi-type interaction). Because of the last interaction, the K_$\Delta$K = -6 transitions occur with intensities comparable to both the infrared active fundamental $\nu$7 and the almost dark combination $\nu$3 + 2$\nu$4 + $\nu$8. The parallel combination system $\nu$8 + $\nu$11 (A 4s, A3s) is overlapped and heavily perturbed by the nearby parallel system $\nu$4 + $\nu$11 + $\nu$12 (A4s, A3s), whose K-structure is spread by the strong z-Coriolis interaction of its two vibrational components. In this work, 95 new transitions to the perturbers of $\nu$7 have been assigned. They belong mostly to the degenerate vibrational states $\nu$8 + $\nu$11 (E1d) and $\nu$3 + 2$\nu$4 + $\nu$8 (E1d), and to the parallel system $\nu$8 + $\nu$11 (A4s, A3s). A least squares fit calculation, limited to the $\nu$7 degenerate fundamental and its degenerate perturbers $\nu$8 + $\nu$11, $\nu$3 + 2$\nu$4 + $\nu$8, $\nu$4 + $\nu$11 + $\nu$12, and $\nu$3 + 3$\nu$4 + $\nu$12 was performed. From the results of this fit, we created a line-by-line database containing the molecular parameters for 4969 transitions in these five bands of 12C2H6. Finally, we identified the degenerate combination band $\nu$2 + $\nu$8 (62 observed transitions) to be the main perturber (x, y-Coriolis-type interaction) of the parallel fundamental $\nu$5. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A high resolution Fourier transform infrared spectrum of C 2H 6, measured at a pressure of 173.3Pa and an optical path of 153.2m, was analysed between 1050 and 1295cm -1. Extensive absorption due to the difference bands v 11-v 4, and several rotation-torsion lines of the difference band v 2-v 4, in the region of the x, y-Coriolis resonance of v 2 and v 11, were observed. This allowed a detailed rotation-torsion analysis of the upper states v 11 and v 2. The anomalous torsional structure, found in the non-degenerate vibrational state v 2, can be explained as the effect of an Hamiltonian term accounting for a strong dependence of the torsional barrier height on the normal vibrational coordinate q 2. The value of the barrier height derivative @V 3/@q 2 is estimated to be 127 ± 10cm -1. Also detected and assigned were 'hot' difference transitions belonging to the (v 4+ v 11)-2v 4 band, yielding information on the upper state v 4 + v 11. It is believed that transitions from 3v 4 to 2v 4 + v 11 are also detectable in the investigated region. {\textcopyright} 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The rovibrational spectrum of the v14 CH3-bending mode of dimethyl sulfide CH3SCH3 was recorded in the 945–1005 cm_1 spectral region combining data from a tunable infrared quantum cascade laser spectrometer coupled to a pulsed slit jet and from a high resolution Fourier transform spectrometer coupled to a room temperature gas absorption cell. The characteristic PQR band contour of a vibrational mode with a b1 symmetry species in the C2v group was observed with both infrared methods but the rovibrational cooling achieved in the pulsed supersonic expansion (20 K in rotation) proved to be essential for starting the rovibrational analysis of such asymmetric top molecule. Internal rotation splittings were recently observed and analyzed in the ground and first torsional excited states. However, they are expected to be very small and could not be resolved in the v14 state using our infrared spectroscopic probes. Therefore a classic reduced effective Hamiltonian of an asymmetric rigid rotor was used. Finally, 1119 transitions from both jet-cooled and room temperature experiments were assigned and included in a global fit with J ≤ 29. A total of 9 rovibrational parameters including pure rotational constants as well as quartic centrifugal distortion constants were determined with high accuracy. These parameters can be used to produce a reliable line-list for an atmospheric detection of DMS.},

Altogether, 40 vibrational bands belonging to the HCC35Cl and 15 bands belonging to the HCC37Cl isotopic species have been rotationally assigned. A vibrational model, based on the conventional rectilinear normal coordinate theory including anharmonic Fermi, Darling-Dennison and vibrational l-type doubling resonances, has been used to attach vibrational labels to the bands. This approach is found to describe well the rovibrational energy level structure at least in the energy range covered in this work. The model shows that the CH oscillator becomes decoupled from the rest of the molecule as vibrational energy increases.},

abstract = {The infrared bands of allene between 1920 and 2028 cm-1 were measured on a large grating spectrometer with effective resolution of 0.006-0.007 cm-1 after deconvolution. The main band in this region is the antisymmetric CC stretching fundamental $\nu$6 of symmetry B2, accompanied on the high-frequency side by the overtone band 2$\nu$9 of the degenerate CH2 rocking vibration. The overtone has three components of species B2, B1, and A1, of which B2 is in Fermi resonance with $\nu$6, B1 has second-order Coriolis interaction with $\nu$6, while A1 is in l-type interaction with the B1 and B2 components. Additional perturbations by other unobserved states were detected in the spectrum. The observed transitions were analyzed with the aid of a general computer program system SYMTOP designed for analysis of symmetric-top spectra. The main program effects a least-squares refinement of the spectroscopic constants for a set of bands whose upper states interact through arbitrary matrix elements. Two sets of spectroscopic constants for the $\nu$6, 2$\nu$9 states were calculated. One, based only on those lines which appear to be unperturbed by unknown and unobserved states, and a second, obtained after inclusion in the H matrix of two perturbing states designed to simulate the effect of the perturbations on all of the data. Comparison indicates that the lower-order constants based merely on the ""unperturbed"" data are quite satisfactory. Molecular constants for the $\nu$9 vibration of C3H4 are reported. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

abstract = {Allene (a-C3H4; CH2CCH2) and propyne (p-C3H4; CH3C2H) have attracted much interest because of their relevance to the photochemistry in astrophysical environments as well as in combustion processes. Both allene and propyne have strong absorption in the infrared region. In the present work, infrared spectra of a-C3H4 and p-C3H4 are measured in the gas phase at temperatures ranging from 296 to 510 K. The spectra are measured over the 580-3400 cm-1 spectral region at resolutions of 0.08 and 0.25 cm-1 using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy. Absolute integrated intensities of the main infrared bands are determined at room temperature and compared with values derived from literature for both molecules. Integrated band intensities are also determined as a function of temperature in various spectral regions.},

abstract = {We present the high resolution spectrum of the $\nu$1 fundamental of propyne near 3335 cm-1 obtained using a very warm free jet expansion in our optothermal detection spectrometer. By using a high concentration sample expanded at low backing pressures we have been able to observe transitions for K values up to K = 6. The additional data available allow us to reinvestigate this vibrational band. We find an unusual perturbation pattern in this band where the individual subbands (rovibrational transitions for a single K value) appear to be completely unperturbed at the level of precision of our data (7.5 MHz), but the subband origin orderings are perturbed through nonresonant interactions. Attempts to account for the subband ordering using a two-state anharmonic interaction are unsuccessful indicating that the perturbations are of multistate origin. This type of nonresonant perturbation to the subband origins of symmetric top molecules should be a common feature of symmetric tops with large A rotational constants. As a result of this investigation we conclude that the previously reported value of $\alpha$A, determined from a very cold expansion where only K = 0 and K = 1 were observed, is not a measure of the true (unperturbed) value of this constant. This conclusion is also supported by force field calculations presented here that use an empirical harmonic force field augmented by diagonal anharmonicities for the hydride stretches. These calculations, which reproduce measured values of $\alpha$A and $\alpha$B for lower energy bands quite successfully, also show that the previous determination of $\alpha$A is too large and must be dominated by perturbation contributions. We have also measured the weak Fermi resonant band $\nu$3+2$\nu$90 which acquires its intensity through interaction with $\nu$1. Again we find an anomalous subband ordering like that observed in $\nu$1. {\textcopyright} 1994 American Institute of Physics.},

Vibration-rotation spectra pertaining to the levels in question were studied in the regions 880-1150 cm-1 (the $\nu$5 and $\nu$8 fundamental bands), 550-750 cm-1 (the v9 = v10 = 1 _ v10 = 1 hot bands) and 250-400 cm-1 (the v10 = 3 _ v10 = 2 ""superhot"" bands).

abstract = {Allene (a-C3H4; CH2CCH2) and propyne (p-C3H4; CH3C2H) have attracted much interest because of their relevance to the photochemistry in astrophysical environments as well as in combustion processes. Both allene and propyne have strong absorption in the infrared region. In the present work, infrared spectra of a-C3H4 and p-C3H4 are measured in the gas phase at temperatures ranging from 296 to 510 K. The spectra are measured over the 580-3400 cm-1 spectral region at resolutions of 0.08 and 0.25 cm-1 using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy. Absolute integrated intensities of the main infrared bands are determined at room temperature and compared with values derived from literature for both molecules. Integrated band intensities are also determined as a function of temperature in various spectral regions.},

abstract = {The far-infrared spectrum of acrolein, CH2CHCHO, is studied in the 100-360 cm-1 region using continuum radiation from a synchrotron source. The combination of a very high resolution spectrometer, a long absorption path, and a low sample pressure, yields observed line widths of less than 0.0008 cm-1. Observation of the $\nu$18 (157.9 cm-1), and $\nu$13 (323.8 cm-1) fundamental bands, together with six hot bands in the same regions, gives information on eight low-lying vibrational states of the molecule, including the Fermi and Coriolis interactions among them. Combining the present assignments with previous data on the $\nu$12 (564.34 cm-1) and $\nu$17 (593.08 cm-1) fundamental bands, all ten excited vibrational levels below 700 cm-1 are analyzed in terms of one 1-state fit, two 2-state fits, and one 5-state fit. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Vibrational states of trans-acrolein (propenal) between 1020 and 1200 cm_1 are analyzed using high-resolution infrared spectra obtained at the Canadian Light Source synchrotron radiation facility. The one fundamental in this range, $\nu$10 (C-C stretch vibration) is found to be strongly mixed with a combination vibration $\nu$14 + $\nu$18 by a Fermi-type interaction. Five additional states are directly observed via hot, combination, and overtone bands: $\nu$11 + $\nu$18, $\nu$16 + $\nu$18, $\nu$15 + $\nu$18, 2$\nu$12, and 2$\nu$17. These seven vibrational states are analyzed in a large multi-state fit, along with nine more states which are not directly observed but which affect the observed states by means of many perturbations. Though this fit is cumbersome, incomplete, and not unique, it can account for 3668 out of 3835 assigned lines with an average error of less than 0.0004 cm_1.},

abstract = {In support of infrared remote sensing of Titan, we present temperature dependent cross-sections of propene (C3H6; CH2[dbnd]CH–CH3; propylene) measured in the laboratory. A total of 27 high-resolution (up to 0.0022 cm_1) spectra of pure C3H6 and mixtures of C3H6 with N2 were obtained at 150–299 K in the 650–1534 cm_1 (6.5–15.4 µm) region. A custom-designed cold cell was used, which was configured with an active temperature control and could be integrated to a Fourier-transform spectrometer (Bruker 125HR) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The observed C3H6 spectral features include its strong v19 band bearing the most prominent Q-branch peak at 912 cm_1 and three other strong bands: v18, v16 and v7 centered near 991, 1443, and 1459 cm_1, respectively. In addition, we have generated empirical pseudoline lists (PLLs) in HITRAN-format, in the two separate spectral regions, which are Region I: 800–1100 and Region II: 1340–1524 cm_1. The PLLs of C3H6 consists of spectroscopic line parameters (including line intensities and effective lower state energies) for all the individual pseudoline positions. The pseudoline parameters were determined by fitting 27 laboratory spectra of pure and N2-broadened propene simultaneously in the selected regions. A newly derived partition function was adopted in the line-by-line radiative transfer calculations. Based on the pseudoline intensities, the total integrated intensities in the 800–1120 and 1320–1524cm_1 regions were measured to be 8.79(47)_ 10_18 and 3.06(21)_10_18cm_1/(molecule cm_2) at 296 K, respectively. These values are found to be in a good agreement with the recent measurement made at KAUST at room temperature, but they are significantly lower than those reported by one of the most extensive previous studies at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). Finally, the two PLLs are submitted as electronic supplements and are also available from the website, https://mark4sun.jpl.nasa.gov/pseudo.html.},

abstract = {The $\nu$9 fundamental band (C-C-C deformation) of propane (C3H8) at 369cm-1 has been studied at high-resolution (0.0011cm-1) with spectra recorded using the synchrotron radiation from the French light source facility at SOLEIL coupled to a Bruker IFS 125HR Fourier transform spectrometer. A 2.526m base multipass cell with optical paths from 10.296 to 151.78m was used. In addition, a spectrum was also recorded using a conventional globar source. Comparison of these experimental spectra shows clearly the gain obtained on the signal-to-noise ratios with the synchrotron radiation. The spectra have been thoroughly analyzed and transitions up to J=65 and Ka=33 have been assigned. The upper-state rotational levels were fitted using an A-type Watson Hamiltonian written in the Ir representation. An accurate band center $\nu$0 ($\nu$9)=369.228080(25)cm-1 as well as accurate rotational and centrifugal distortion constants have been obtained and used to simulate a synthetic spectrum. These parameters should be useful to simulate hot bands of propane involving the 91 vibrational level as their lower state. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {Using high-resolution Fourier transform spectra of propane recorded in the 13.4 m (resolution 0.002 cm-1) and in the 27.4 m (resolution 0.0011 cm-1) spectral regions, it was possible to perform a thorough assignment of both the 26 band at 745 cm-1 and the 29-9 band at about 370 cm-1. This simultaneous assignment was necessary since the 261 and 92 rotational levels interact strongly through an A-type Coriolis interaction. The experimental upper-state rotational levels were fit using a Hamiltonian matrix which takes into account explicitly this strong A-type Coriolis interaction. With this model the experimental energy levels were fit to within their experimental uncertainties and accurate band centres, rotational, centrifugal distortion and coupling constants were determined. The following band centres were derived: o(26) = 748.530882(80) cm-1 and o(29) = 740.29213(10) cm-1. Finally, it is shown how the use of these new spectral parameters greatly improves the accuracy of modelling of Titan's infrared spectrum at 13.4 m, relative to the currently available GEISA atlas for the same band. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {A wide-ranging investigation of high-resolution infrared spectra of 1,3-butadiene was undertaken with the prime objective of finding subbands in the rotational structure attributable to the gauche rotamer, from which information about the molecular structure could be derived. A weak band near 750 cm -1, which had previously been assigned to the gauche rotamer, has been shown to be a difference band for the trans rotamer. In support of the analysis of this band, the rotational structure, including two hot bands, was analyzed in the C-type band for the v12(au) mode near 525 cm-1 and in the C-type band near 162 cm-1 for the v 13(au) mode. An unsuccessful attempt was made to extend the analysis of the B-type component of the A/B-type band for V 17(bu) near 3000 cm-1. With the exception of the two weak Q branches at 463.82 and 462.16 cm-1, no new evidence for the gauche rotamer in the gas phase was found. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The high resolution far-infrared spectrum of trans-butadiene has been reinvestigated by Fourier-transform spectroscopy at two synchrotron radiation facilities, SOLEIL and the Canadian Light Source, at temperatures ranging from 50 to 340 K. Beyond the well-studied bands, two new fundamental bands lying below 1100 cm-1, $\nu$10 and $\nu$24, have been assigned using a combination of cross-correlation (ASAP software) and Loomis-Wood type (LWWa software) diagrams. While the $\nu$24 analysis was rather straightforward, $\nu$10 exhibits obvious signs of a strong perturbation, presumably owing to interaction with the dark $\nu$9 + $\nu$12 state. Effective rotational constants have been derived for both the v10 = 1 and v24 = 1 states. Since only one weak, infrared active fundamental band ($\nu$23) of trans-butadiene remains to be observed at high resolution in the far-infrared, searches for the elusive gauche conformer can now be undertaken with considerably greater confidence in the dense ro-vibrational spectrum of the trans form.},

abstract = {A wide-ranging investigation of high-resolution infrared spectra of 1,3-butadiene was undertaken with the prime objective of finding subbands in the rotational structure attributable to the gauche rotamer, from which information about the molecular structure could be derived. A weak band near 750 cm -1, which had previously been assigned to the gauche rotamer, has been shown to be a difference band for the trans rotamer. In support of the analysis of this band, the rotational structure, including two hot bands, was analyzed in the C-type band for the v12(au) mode near 525 cm-1 and in the C-type band near 162 cm-1 for the v 13(au) mode. An unsuccessful attempt was made to extend the analysis of the B-type component of the A/B-type band for V 17(bu) near 3000 cm-1. With the exception of the two weak Q branches at 463.82 and 462.16 cm-1, no new evidence for the gauche rotamer in the gas phase was found. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The high resolution far-infrared spectrum of trans-butadiene has been reinvestigated by Fourier-transform spectroscopy at two synchrotron radiation facilities, SOLEIL and the Canadian Light Source, at temperatures ranging from 50 to 340 K. Beyond the well-studied bands, two new fundamental bands lying below 1100 cm-1, $\nu$10 and $\nu$24, have been assigned using a combination of cross-correlation (ASAP software) and Loomis-Wood type (LWWa software) diagrams. While the $\nu$24 analysis was rather straightforward, $\nu$10 exhibits obvious signs of a strong perturbation, presumably owing to interaction with the dark $\nu$9 + $\nu$12 state. Effective rotational constants have been derived for both the v10 = 1 and v24 = 1 states. Since only one weak, infrared active fundamental band ($\nu$23) of trans-butadiene remains to be observed at high resolution in the far-infrared, searches for the elusive gauche conformer can now be undertaken with considerably greater confidence in the dense ro-vibrational spectrum of the trans form.},

abstract = {A quantum-mechanical (hybrid MP2/cc-pVTZ and CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ) full quartic potential energy surface (PES) in rectilinear normal coordinates and the second-order operator canonical Van Vleck perturbation theory (CVPT2) are employed to predict the anharmonic vibrational spectra of s-trans- and s-gauche-butadiene (BDE). These predictions are used to interpret their infrared and Raman scattering spectra. New high-temperature Raman spectra in the gas phase are presented in support of assignments for the gauche conformer. The CVPT2 solution is based on a PES and electro-optical properties (EOP; dipole moment and polarizability) expanded in Taylor series. Higher terms than those routinely available from Gaussian09 software were calculated by numerical differentiation of quadratic force fields and EOP using the MP2/cc-pVTZ model. The integer coefficients of the polyad quantum numbers were derived for both conformers of BDE. Replacement of harmonic frequencies by their counterparts from the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ model significantly improved the agreement with experimental data for s-trans-BDE (root-mean-square deviation ≈ 5.5 cm-1). The accuracy in predicting the rather well-studied spectrum of fundamentals of s-trans-BDE assures good predictions of the spectrum of s-gauche-BDE. A nearly complete assignment of fundamentals was obtained for the gauche conformer. Many nonfundamental transitions of the BDE conformers were interpreted as well. The predictions of multiple Fermi resonances in the complex CH-stretching region correlate well with experiment. It is shown that solving a vibrational anharmonic problem through a numerical-analytic implementation of CVPT2 is a straightforward and computationally advantageous approach for medium-size molecules in comparison with the standard second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2) based on analytic expressions.},

abstract = {First high-resolution spectroscopic and structural data for jet-cooled frans-1,3-butadiene have been obtained using sub-Doppler, direct absorption tunable difference frequency infrared laser methods in a pulsed slit supersonic expansion. With reduced spectral congestion at Trovib = 15 K, high-resolution vibration-rotation spectra around 3100 cm-1 reveal two hybrid a/b type bands, both of which have been successfully rotationally analyzed and yield first experimental structural information on the ground state of trans-1,3-butadiene. The strong band v17(bu) at 3100.63 cm-1 is predominantly due to ""bright"" state excitation of the in-phase asymmetric CH2 stretch, with the weaker band at 3096.14 cm-1 probably arising from a ""dark"" state anharmonic mixing with VH. Furthermore, there are many local perturbations in the spectrum that can be successfully explained via anharmonic and Coriolis type coupling between v17 and an additional dark state centered at 3100.65 cm-1. Intensity analysis for the strong and weak bands permits a- and b-type transition moment ratios to be extracted and compared with results from electronic structure calculations.},

The test molecules were ethylene, propene, isobutene, cis- and trans-1-butene, cis- and trans-2-butene, trans- and cis-1,3-butadiene, isoprene, trans- and cis-1,3,5-hexatriene, and trans-1,3,5,7-octatetraene. A set of 26 independent force constants was found to be sufficient to describe correctly their structures, potential energy surfaces, and vibrational frequencies. The r.m.s. deviation between the predicted and observed frequencies was about 15 cm-1. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {The Raman spectrum of the symmetric stretching vibration ($\nu$1) of liquid carbon tetrachloride observed at 295 K and reported repeatedly over the last 80 years clearly shows four of the five more abundant isotopomers at 440-470 cm-1. At the lower energy end of this spectrum, additional intensity due to isotopomeric contributions from the symmetric stretch for v = 1_2 (hotbands) partially overlaps the prominent v = 0_1 features, and accounts for about 18%of the integrated intensity at 295 K in agreement with theory. When these two patterns are modeled and subtracted from the experimental spectrum, a feature underlying almost exactly the C35Cl4 (v= 0_1) band at 462.5 cm-1 becomes apparent. We propose that this feature is the $\nu$3 - $\nu$4 difference band. Observations at lower temperatures, and of the combination bands, and the polarized Raman spectra are consistent with this hypothesis.},

abstract = {Seven bands of the A2$\Delta$-X2$\Pi$ system of the CH radical have been photographed in emission from a Geissler tube using conventional spectroscopic techniques. Under high resolution and using Th lines as standards, as well as an interferometric comparator equipped with a photoelectric scanning device, the 0-0, 1-1, 2-2, 0-1, and 1-2 bands have been rephotographed and the 3-3 and 2-3 bands, with a total number of 144 lines, have been recorded for the first time. In the previously reported (J. Mol. Spectrosc.134, 305, 1989; 147, 16, 1991) evaluation of the ATMOS spectrum of CH for determining the molecular parameters we found total interparameter correlations between some of them, due to the absence of high-J lines of the P and Q branches. With the help of the precise constants obtained from our 0-0 band measurements (12 branches with Jmax = 24.5, f = 181, $\sigma$ = 0.0025 cm-1) of the A2$\Delta$-X2$\Pi$ transition, we have been able to remove the correlations and obtain more accurate molecular parameters for the X2$\Pi$ ground state. These constants have subsequently been used to derive new exact molecular parameters for the A2$\Delta$, $\nu$ = 1, 2, and 3 levels of CH. The $\Lambda$-doubling constants in the A2$\Delta$ state were obtained for the first time. The complex vibrational analysis has been carried out to determine the equilibrium molecular constants. Also, RKR potentials and r-centroids have been calculated for both the combining states, as well as Franck-Condon factors for the A-X system. {\textcopyright} 1995 Academic Press Inc.},

Term values for the $\nu$2 = 1 vibrational state with Ka up to 5 have been obtained and subband origins, effective rotational constants B and centrifugal distortion constants D and H were determined for each Ka substate.},

abstract = {Using high-resolution Fourier transform spectra of trans-HCOOH recorded at 5.6 $\mu$m, we carried out an extensive analysis of the strong $\nu$3 fundamental band (carbonyl stretching mode) at 1776.83 cm-1, starting from results of a previous analysis [Weber WH, Maker PD, Johns JWC, Weinberger E. J Mol Spectrosc 1987; 121: 243-60]. As pointed out in the literature, the $\nu$3 band is significantly perturbed by resonances due to numerous dark bands. We were able to assign series belonging to the $\nu$5+$\nu$7, $\nu$5+$\nu$9, $\nu$6+$\nu$7 and $\nu$6+$\nu$9 dark bands, located at 1843.48, 1792.63, 1737.96 and 1726.40 cm-1, respectively. The model used to calculate energy levels accounts partly for the observed resonances, and enabled us to reproduce most of the observed line positions, within their experimental uncertainties. We also determined absolute line intensities with an accuracy estimated to 15%. Finally, we generated, for the first time, a list of line parameters for the 5.6 $\mu$m region of trans-formic acid. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Forty scans were recorded for the range 750-1400 cm-1 at a total pressure of 0.15 mbar. A thorough analysis of the three lowest wavenumber fundamental bands, $\nu$3, $\nu$4 and $\nu$6, which fall in this region, has been carried out using a Hamiltonian model, which takes explicitly into account the numerous resonances affecting the ro-vibrational energy levels; especially the massive A-type Coriolis resonance between the out-of-plane wagging mode, $\nu$4, and the in-plane rocking mode, $\nu$6. These two modes are only separated by 0.83 cm-1, and they are thoroughly mixed. From the fittings, the following band centers were derived: $\nu$o ($\nu$4)=990.18213(40) cm-1, $\nu$o ($\nu$6)=991.02021(50) cm-1 and $\nu$o ($\nu$3)=1059.20476 (30) cm-1 where the uncertainties are one standard deviation. In addition, a number of relative line intensities were measured permitting the determination of relative values of the first-order transition moments and therefore relative band intensities for all three bands. Finally, a comprehensive list of line wavenumbers and relative intensities has been generated. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A thorough analysis of the three lowest wavenumber fundamental bands, $\nu$3, $\nu$4 and $\nu$6, which fall in this region, has been carried out using a Hamiltonian model, which takes explicitly into account the numerous resonances affecting the ro-vibrational energy levels; especially the massive A-type Coriolis resonance between the out-of-plane wagging mode, $\nu$4, and the in-plane rocking mode, $\nu$6. These two modes are only separated by 0.83 cm-1, and they are thoroughly mixed. From the fittings, the following band centers were derived: $\nu$o ($\nu$4)=990.18213(40) cm-1, $\nu$o ($\nu$6)=991.02021(50) cm-1 and $\nu$o ($\nu$3)=1059.20476 (30) cm-1 where the uncertainties are one standard deviation. In addition, a number of relative line intensities were measured permitting the determination of relative values of the first-order transition moments and therefore relative band intensities for all three bands. Finally, a comprehensive list of line wavenumbers and relative intensities has been generated. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is one of the most abundant chlorine-containing molecules in the atmosphere. For this reason a recent update was performed in HITRAN in the 640-2600cm-1 region based on the line parameters generated in Nikitin et al. [Nikitin A, Champion JP, B{\""{u}}rger H. J Mol Spectrosc 2005;230:174-84] with the intensities scaled to existing experimental data. CH3Cl has a rather strong signature around 3000cm-1 which was used recently by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) satellite mission to produce the first study of the global distribution of methyl chloride in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. However, it was mentioned that the CH3Cl line positions and intensities spectroscopic parameters are of very low quality in this spectral region in the public access HITRAN or GEISA databases. We present a complete update of the line positions and line intensities for the $\nu$1, $\nu$4, 3$\nu$6 bands of CH335Cl and CH337Cl in the 3.4$\mu$m region. For this task, Fourier transform spectra have been recorded at high resolution at the Laboratoire de Dynamique, Interactions et R{\'{e}}activit{\'{e}} in France. Measurements of line positions and line intensities have been retrieved for both isotopologues 12CH335Cl and 12CH337Cl in the $\nu$1, $\nu$4, 3$\nu$6 bands. The theoretical model accounts for the interactions coupling the ($\nu$1=1; _=0), ($\nu$4=1; _=±1) and ($\nu$6=3; _=±1) energy levels, together with additional resonances involving several dark states. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The vibration-rotational bands $\nu$2 and $\nu$5 of gaseous fluoromethane H312CF have been measured in the region 1250-1600 cm-1 with resolution 0.0034 cm-1; the 2046 lines that have been assigned include 85 lines of the $\Delta$k = ±2 perturbation-allowed transitions to the doubly degenerate vibrational state v5 = 1. A variational approach has been applied to the analysis of both bands which are strongly perturbed by x-y Coriolis interaction and by ""2, -1"" l-type coupling. Simultaneously with 96 previously reported frequencies of pure rotational transitions in the ground vibrational state and 202 frequencies in the excited vibrational states v2 = 1 and v5 = 1 [Pracna, Papou{\v{s}}ek, Belov, Tretyakov, and Sarka, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 146, 120-126 (1991)], the wavenumbers of 2046 vibration-rotational transitions of the bands $\nu$2 and $\nu$5 have been fitted to determine 7 parameters of the $\nu$2 band and 21 parameters of the $\nu$5 band. The ground state parameters A0 = 5.1820107(12) cm-1 and DK0 10-6 = 70.39(15) cm-1 are in excellent agreement with those determined previously [Graner, Mol. Phys. 31, 1833-1843 (1976)]. A standard deviation of 8.0 _ 10-4 cm-1 has been obtained in the simultaneous fit of the infrared data and 0.38 MHz of the rotational frequencies of the upper state, but in the $\nu$5 band inexplicable systematic differences up to 0.02 cm-1 between the experimental and calculated wavenumbers remain for certain values of the rotational quantum number K at J > 25. From the analysis of the absolute intensities of lines of the $\nu$2 and $\nu$5 bands, we found that (∂$\mu$x ∂q5a)/( ∂$\mu$z ∂q2) = +1.75, which indicates a negative perturbation of intensity ($\zeta$2.5ay<0). {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {The C-S stretching fundamental band of 12CH332SH, the principal isotopologue of methyl mercaptan, has been investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy on the Far-Infrared beamline at the Canadian Light Source synchrotron. The band is centered around 710 cm-1 and shows well-resolved a-type parallel structure. Most of the A and E spectral sub-bands have been assigned up to K = 12 for the vt = 0 torsional state and K = 9 for the vt = 1 state, along with a smaller variety of sub-bands for vt = 2. C-S stretching energy term values have been determined employing known ground-state energies, and have been fitted to series expansions in powers of J(J + 1) to determine the substate origins. The origins have in turn been fitted to a Fourier model to characterize the oscillatory torsional energy structure of the C-S stretching state. The amplitude of oscillation of the vt = 0 torsional curves is significantly larger for the C-S stretch state compared to the ground state. A strategy devised to relate this amplitude to an effective torsional barrier height indicates a decrease of about 7% in the effective V3 for the C-S stretch. The vibrational frequency determined for the stretching fundamental from the Fourier fit is 710.3 cm-1. The C-S stretching manifold is crossed by excited vt = 4 torsional levels of the ground state, and strong torsion-vibrational resonant coupling is observed via perturbations in the spectrum together with forbidden sub-bands induced by mixing and intensity borrowing.},

abstract = {Attention has been focused recently on the harmful effects and malodor of methyl mercaptan (CH3SH), so it is desired to detect CH3SH in situ, sensitively, and selectively. We detected methyl mercaptan via tunable laser absorption spectroscopy (TLAS) with a room-temperature distributed feedback interband cascade laser emitting around 3393 nm and a hollow waveguide gas cell with 5 m length. The fundamental characteristic fingerprint absorptions of CH3SH from 3260 to 3400 nm were examined, and the spectral line 3393.584 nm (corresponding to the $\nu$2 C–H symmetric stretch) was determined to be the optimum for CH3SH detection. The response characteristics of the TLAS system were established by implementing a set of CH3SH concentration gradient experiments with wavelength-scanned direct absorption spectroscopy. The results show that CH3SH TLAS spectra are in excellent agreement with spectra from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory database; the TLAS response linearity is 0.987, and the detection limit is as low as 25 ppbv (parts per billion by volume, 10_9) with integrated time 1.84 s, corresponding to an absorbance of 1.34 _ 10_4 (near the theoretical detection limit). Overall, the TLAS system is a robust method for CH3SH monitoring of industrial waste gas emissions.},

abstract = {The infrared Fourier transform spectrum of the S–H stretching fundamental band of 12CH332SH has been recorded using synchrotron radiation at the far-infrared beamline of the Canadian Light Source in Saskatoon. The S–H stretch is a hybrid band predominantly of perpendicular b-type with a small parallel a-component. With both $\Delta$K = +1 and $\Delta$K = _1 sub-bands present, the assignments are well determined from ground-state combination difference relations. The identified sub-bands access S–H stretching ground torsional substates from K_ = 0–14 for A and E torsional species. The substate origins have been obtained by expanding the term values in J(J + 1) power series, and have been fitted to a simple 6-parameter Fourier Hamiltonian to deduce the torsional energies. The oscillation amplitude of the S–H stretching torsional curves is 0.547 cm_1 compared to 0.653 cm_1 for the ground state, implying an increase on the order of 6.9% in the torsional barrier height. The vibrational wavenumber for the S–H stretch mode is found to be 2603.5 cm_1.},

The high resolution infrared spectrum has been analyzed in the 40 to 360 cm_1 region with a resolution of 0.00125 cm_1. In the IR spectrum the complete RR and RQ series of rotational transitions were assigned up to high values of K and J, and for all symmetry species. For each set of rotational transitions a joint fit of all symmetry species has been carried out. The assigned transitions were fit to a single state model based on the group theoretical formalism of Hougen and Ohashi. The standard deviation of the fit for the ground state with K ≤ 20 and J ≤ 50 to 78 parameters was 0.00031 cm_1. The standard deviation of the fit for the first excited state with K ≤ 20 and J ≤ 45 to 89 parameters was 0.00066 cm_1, whereas for the second excited torsional state with K ≤ 14 and J ≤ 40 and with 95 parameters a standard deviation of 0.00207 cm_1 was obtained.

abstract = {The assignment of the wagging band, 9, of methylamine was extended to weak and perturbed series in a new high-resolution spectrum in the region from 640 to 960 cm-1 with extensive use of new Loomis-Wood software for Windows for the LAV molecules. Compared with previous reports, the number of assigned transitions in the wagging band (13,000) has been doubled. Most series extend as far as J = 40, even for symmetry species of lower statistical weight. For low K values (K_ = 0 and 1), even transitions of mixed type, E1+1 _ E1-1, have been observed. Several branches are strongly perturbed by Fermi and Coriolis-type resonances. An attempt to fit the observed transitions to a single-state model resulted in a standard deviation of 0.018 cm-1. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {For the first time the $\nu$4 NH2 scissors band has been assigned in a high-resolution infrared spectrum. A rotationally resolved spectrum of methylamine was recorded using two infrared spectroscopic techniques. A White-type multi-pass cell device coupled to the Bruker IFS 125 HR Fourier transform spectrometer was implemented on the AILES beamline at the SOLEIL synchrotron facility and a room-temperature spectrum of the whole band in the region of 1540–1710 cm_1 was recorded with a resolution of 0.001 cm_1. Then, a low-temperature high-resolution spectrum in the 1622.5–1655.6 cm_1 range of Q and R branches of the $\nu$4 band was recorded using a quantum cascade laser spectrometer. Preliminary assignment was carried out in the NH2 scissors band region, and about 2200 transitions for K from 0 to 6 have been assigned for A, B, and E1 symmetry species. The simultaneous fit of assigned lines using a group-theoretical effective Hamiltonian was not successful; instead simple polynomial series expansions were used for each symmetry and K value.},

abstract = {The vibration-torsion-rotation spectrum of CH3SiH3 has been measured from 470 to 725 cm-1 at near-Doppler resolution. The full-width at half - maximum of the lines observed near 600 cm-1 was 0.0011 cm-1. The spectra were obtained using a Bruker IFS 125 HR Fourier transform spectrometer with the broadband source radiation being supplied from the synchrotron emission of the storage ring at the Canadian Light Source. Three vibrational bands were investigated: the lowest lying perpendicular fundamental $\nu$12 centred near 524 cm-1, the lowest lying parallel fundamental $\nu$5 near 703 cm-1, and the torsional hot band $\nu$12 + $\nu$6 - $\nu$6 near 534 cm-1. For $\nu$12 and $\nu$5, the resolution and sensitivity are much improved over those in earlier studies, with many of the torsional multiplets now being resolved even in the cases where the upper levels are unperturbed. The primary motivation for the present work was the hot band, here reported for the first time, where the dependence of the silyl rock in $\nu$12 on the torsional motion is much more pronounced. In addition, for the vibrational ground state (gs), two ""forbidden"" high torsional overtones v6 = 3 _ 0 and 5 _ 0 have been observed that become allowed through resonant mixing of the upper states with $\nu$12 and $\nu$5, respectively. In each case, two (K, $\sigma$) series have been measured where the mixing is largest. Here $\sigma$ = 0, 1, -1 labels the torsional sub-levels. Using the Fourier transform waveguide spectrometer at E. T. H., the three $\sigma$-components of the (J = 1 _ 0) transition in $\nu$12 + $\nu$6 were observed, and a series of direct l-doubling transitions in $\nu$12 + $\nu$6 were measured for $\sigma$ = 0. In a global fit, all the new data have been analysed along with the frequencies for other transitions obtained in earlier investigations. The analysis takes into account the relevant interactions among the torsional stacks of levels in the gs, $\nu$12, and $\nu$5. These include the previously known (gs, $\nu$12) Coriolis-like and (gs, $\nu$5) Fermi-like interactions along with a higher order ($\nu$12, $\nu$5) Coriolis-like coupling introduced here. This last is responsible for the strong perturbation of the $\nu$5 series with K = 10, 11, and 12, and of the corresponding hot band series. A good fit to 9282 frequencies including 7942 new measurements was obtained both with the Free Rotor model in which the torsion is classified as a rotation, and with the High Barrier model in which the torsion is classified as a vibration. The Hamiltonian is discussed with emphasis on the new terms required for treating $\nu$12 + $\nu$6 - $\nu$6. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

When we combined them with the wavenumbers of the fundamental $\nu$ 6 band, we were able to determine accurately the axial rotational constants in the vibrational ground state C 0=0.05715783 (20) cm -1, DK0=2.759 (63)10 -8cm -1, and even HK0=-8.27 (75)10 -14cm -1. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The infrared spectrum of chloroform in the region of the parallel fundamental band $\nu$3 around 367 cm_1 has been measured with a Fourier spectrometer at a resolution of 0.001 cm_1. An isotopically pure sample of CH35Cl3 was used. More than 5000 lines were assigned in the $\nu$3 band. A reanalysis of the ground state constants was performed by combining 1671 combination differences from this work, 712 differences from a previous study of the $\nu$2 band, and 80 millimetre wave lines from the literature. In the analysis of the $\nu$3 band, a model of an unperturbed symmetric top band was applied. The data were fitted with a standard deviation of 0.18 _ 10_3 cm_1, and the following leading parameters were obtained: $\nu$0 = 367.295 550(8) cm_1, B 3—B 0 = _77.058(4) _ 10_6 cm_1 and C 3—C 0 = _18.600(11) _ 10_6 cm_1. In addition, several hot bands have been studied. The isotopic effects were studied also by analysing spectra of the isotopically natural sample. {\textcopyright} 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The absorption spectrum of trifluoromethane has been recorded between 900 and 14 000 cm-1 with resolutions between 0.004 and 0.5 cm -1 (pressure broadened). 22 bands were assigned as arising from the interacting CH stretching and bending manifolds, which account for most of the absorption in the overtone region. The results can be understood quantitatively with an effective, tridiagonal many-level Fermi resonance Hamiltonian. The experimental and theoretical results are summarized in Table II. The Hamiltonian is given in Table III and shows a very large stretching-bending interaction constant |ksbb|=106 cm-1, which is even larger than the diagonal anharmonic constant for the stretching vibration |x_ ss|=62 cm-1. This leads to extensive vibrational redistribution between stretching and bending motions at high levels of excitation. The time dependent redistribution is calculated with the spectroscopic Hamiltonian. A rotational analysis is presented for some of the bands involved in the Fermi resonance. The effect of the Fermi resonance on hot bands is investigated using the same Hamiltonian in comparison with experiment. The results are discussed in relation to the universal local dynamics of the isolated alkyl CH-stretching chromophore and in relation to the vibrational dynamics of highly excited polyatomic molecules as a function of certain elements of molecular structure. {\textcopyright} 1984 American Institute of Physics.},

The spectra require reassignment of the stretching fundamentals and reveal the previously unknown bending fundamental. The new assignment (solid phase: v1 = 630.7, v2 = 296.4, v3 = 670.8 cm-1) results in a new value for the Cl-O bond stretching force constant, Kr=2.75 mdyn/{\AA}, which is strikingly lower than values previously cited. The bond in chlorine monoxide is proposed as the prototype Cl-O single bond. The low stretching-force constant indicates little ionic character in the Cl-O bond, in disagreement with conclusions based on nuclear quadrupole coupling data.},

J Mol Spectrosc 1998;190:101–6]: (i) the use of synchrotron radiation which resulted in a better signal-to-noise ratio; (ii) a resolution twice better; (iii) a low temperature (221 K) with an optical path length of 8.16 m, allowing low pressure (0.025 hPa) in the sample leading to a well resolved spectrum. As a consequence, significantly better results than previously were obtained. Thanks to the new experimental conditions, the line assignments were pursued up to higher J and Ka quantum number values, J = 83 and Ka = 44. For both isotopomers, a total of 6331 transitions were reproduced with a root-mean-square deviation of 2 _ 10_4 cm_1 using a Watson-type A-reduced Hamiltonian. Improved rotational and centrifugal distortion constants for the $\nu$3 fundamental bands of 35ClNO2 and37ClNO2 have been determined. The band centers are 370.1510773(92) cm_1 for the $\nu$3 fundamental band of 35ClNO2 and 364.5218094(96) cm_1 for the $\nu$3 fundamental band of 37ClNO2. The synthetic line list obtained in this study could be interesting for future measurements of ClNO2 in the atmosphere, e.g. using the new space mission FORUM which is one of the concepts chosen by ESA to be developed further and which opens up a new window (150–1400 cm_1) for understanding and quantifying the radiative processes, as well as air quality and pollution effects.},

abstract = {The 12.6 µm region of nitryl chloride (ClNO2) has been recorded at high resolution (0.00102 cm_1) using a Fourier transform spectrometer and the SOLEIL synchrotron light source. ClNO2 was found during our studies of chlorine nitrate and, after fractional distillations it was introduced into a multipass White cell made of inert materials, with an optical path length of 5.4 m. 320 scans were recorded for the range 600–980 cm_1 at a total pressure of 0.23 hPa and a temperature of 250 K. A thorough analysis of the $\nu$2, 2$\nu$6 and 2$\nu$3 bands of 35ClNO2 and of the $\nu$2 band of 37ClNO2 falling in this region has been carried out using a Hamiltonian model which takes explicitly into account the numerous resonances affecting the ro-vibrational energy levels; especially the C-type Coriolis resonance between the $\nu$2 and the $\nu$3+ $\nu$6 modes. These two modes are only separated by less than 20 cm_1 and are thoroughly mixed. From the fittings, the following band centers were derived: $\nu$o($\nu$2) = 792.761264(60) cm_1, $\nu$o($\nu$3 + $\nu$6) = 775.8923(20) cm_1, $\nu$o(2$\nu$3) = 734.183576(20) cm_1 and $\nu$o(2$\nu$6) = 819.836727(90) cm_1 for 35ClNO2 and $\nu$o($\nu$2) = 792.258284(30) cm_1 and $\nu$o($\nu$3 + $\nu$6) = 774.6826(30) cm_1 for 37ClNO2 where the uncertainties are one standard deviation. Due to their sharp Q branches falling into an atmospheric “window”, the detection of the $\nu$2 bands might be an advantageous route for future attempts to quantify atmospheric ClNO2, using infrared techniques.},

To reduce the spectral congestion, the spectra have been recorded at low temperature (197 K) using a 93.14 m optical path length cryogenic cell. This enables the first detailed infrared analysis of the $\nu$3 bands of the 35Cl2CO and 35Cl37ClCO isotopologues of phosgene. Using a Watson-type Hamiltonian, it was possible to reproduce the upper state rovibrational infrared energy levels, together with, for 35Cl2CO, the available microwave data in the 31 excited state (Yamamoto et al. 1984) to within their experimental accuracy. In this way, accurate rotational and centrifugal distortion constants together with the following band centers: $\nu$0($\nu$3, 35Cl2CO) = 301.545622(17) cm_1 and $\nu$0($\nu$3, 35Cl37ClCO) = 298.199194(81) cm_1, were derived for the $\nu$3 bands of 35Cl2CO and 35Cl37ClCO.},

abstract = {Concern about the implication of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in atmospheric ozone depletion has led to numerous measurements of the concentrations of halogen-containing compounds in the stratosphere. Of the various possible oxidation products of CFC's in the stratosphere, carbonyl chlorofluoride (COFCl) may receive special attention. High-resolution atmospheric infrared spectra are potential means of monitoring COFCl. However, there is little information on the spectroscopy of this molecule in the literature. We have therefore recorded spectra of pure 35Cl-enriched and natural samples of COFCl at ≤0.0033 cm_1 resolution with the BRUKER Fourier transform spectrometer at the University of Wuppertal. We present here the first high-resolution analysis of the six fundamental bands v1 (CO stretching mode), v2 (C-F stretching mode), v3 (C-Cl stretching mode), v4 (CFCl bending mode), v5 (CFCl rocking mode), and v6 (out of plane bending mode) located at 1875.8256, 1095.0646, 764.3876, 501.5941, 408.8099, and 666.5862 cm_1, respectively, for the COF35Cl isotopic species of carbonyl chlorofluoride. The v3, v4, v5, and v6 bands which are mainly of A-type, B-type, B-type, and C-type, respectively, appear as unperturbed.

abstract = {Using 0.0025-cm-1 resolution Fourier transform laboratory spectra, a thorough analysis of the $\nu$4 band of COF2 has been performed leading to an extensive (up to J = 77 and Ka = 46) and precise (±0.0002 cm-1) set of energy levels for the v4 = 1 vibrational state of this molecule. It proved not possible to reproduce these experimental levels when considering the v4 = 1 vibrational state as isolated, and it has been necessary to take into account the Coriolis-type resonance between the levels of this state and those of a nearby state located about 4 cm-1 below. In this way, an accurate band center ($\nu$0($\nu$4) = 1243.26609 ± 0.00014 cm-1) and rotational and coupling constants were derived. These constants were then used to generate a comprehensive list of line parameters suitable for high-resolution atmospheric studies. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

In this region the $\nu$1band at 1945 cm_1dominates the spectrum and is in Fermi resonance with the 2$\nu$2band at 1914 cm_1and in B-type Coriolis resonance with the 2$\nu$3+ $\nu$4band at 1936 cm_1. From the $\nu$1band, 820 lines were successfully fitted using an S-type Watson Hamiltonian in theIIIlrepresentation, yielding rotational and fourth order centrifugal distortion constants, a Coriolis parameter of 0.00339(24) cm_1, and an obs-calc RMS of 0.0006 cm_1. Only 400 lines from 2$\nu$2could be successfully fitted, with an obs-calc RMS of 0.0005 cm_1, because of interference from $\nu$1over much of the 2$\nu$2Rbranch.},

Forty-one transitions of the Q branch of the fundamental up to J = 43 have been measured, in addition to 21 transitions of the O and S branches of this band. Twenty-one transitions of the Q branch of the first hot band up to J = 27 have also been measured. From the analysis of these data a more accurate set of molecular parameters for the v = 0, v = 1, and v = 2 states of this molecule has been derived.

Spectra were recorded in absorption using a Fourier-transform spectrometer with the sample of SOF2 held in a gas cell at a temperature of 294 K. In total, 1929 a- and c-type vibration-rotation transitions of the most abundant isotopomer, 32S16OF2, have been assigned and included in a least-squares fit. The least-squares analysis, performed using a standard semi-rigid rotor Hamiltonian, has yielded precise spectroscopic parameters for the $\nu$2 = 1 level. The analysis confirms the assignment of the band to excitation of the symmetric S-F stretching vibration. Additional, partially resolved features are attributed to the Q-branches of the $\nu$2 fundamental band of 34S16OF2 and of $\nu$2 difference bands from low-lying excited vibrational levels.},

abstract = {This work, besides its fundamental interest is mainly motivated by the atmospheric importance of formaldehyde. The 10-$\mu$m region is indeed a possible spectral domain for the detection of this molecule in the atmosphere and no line parameters are presently available in the atmospheric databases for H2CO in this spectral range. Using the experimental data available in the literature for the v3, v4 and v6 bands [J. Chem. Phys. 91 (1989) 646 and references therein] and for the v2(band [J. Mol.

abstract = {The two triad systems of hydrogen sulfide (2$\nu$2, $\nu$1, and $\nu$3 near 4 $\mu$m and 3$\nu$2, $\nu$1 + $\nu$2, and $\nu$2 + $\nu$3 near 2.7 $\mu$m) were analyzed using 14 spectra recorded at 0.0056 and 0.011 cm-1 resolution with the McMath Fourier transform spectrometer located at Kitt Peak National Observatory. Experimental upper state levels of H232S, H234S, and H233S were obtained from assigned positions (as high as J= 20 and Ka = 15 for the main isotope). These were fitted to the A-reduced Watson Hamiltonian to determine precise sets of rotational constants through J10 and up to nine Fermi and Coriolis coupling parameters. Intensities of the two H232S triads were modeled with rms values of 2.5%, using the transformed transition moment expansion with 19 terms for 568 intensities of the first triad and 11 terms for the 526 intensities of the second triad. The second derivatives of the dipole moment with respect to normal coordinates were estimated in Debye to be: 22$\mu$x = -0.004873 (90); 12$\mu$x = 0.01372 (30); and 23$\mu$z 0.01578 (30). This confirmed that for hydrogen sulfide some of the second derivatives are larger than the first derivatives. The calculated line intensities were summed yielding integrated band strengths (in cm-2/atm at 296 K) as follows: 0.3315 for 2$\nu$2, 0.4522 for V1, 0.1201 for $\nu$3, 0.0303 for 3$\nu$2, 1.820 for $\nu$1 + $\nu$2, and 2.869 for $\nu$2 + $\nu$3. In addition, the hot band transitions were identified in both regions. Finally, a composite database of hydrogen sulfide line parameters was predicted for the 5- to 2.5-$\mu$m region, {\textcopyright} 1998 Academic Press.},

abstract = {The two triad systems of hydrogen sulfide (2$\nu$2, $\nu$1, and $\nu$3 near 4 $\mu$m and 3$\nu$2, $\nu$1 + $\nu$2, and $\nu$2 + $\nu$3 near 2.7 $\mu$m) were analyzed using 14 spectra recorded at 0.0056 and 0.011 cm-1 resolution with the McMath Fourier transform spectrometer located at Kitt Peak National Observatory. Experimental upper state levels of H232S, H234S, and H233S were obtained from assigned positions (as high as J= 20 and Ka = 15 for the main isotope). These were fitted to the A-reduced Watson Hamiltonian to determine precise sets of rotational constants through J10 and up to nine Fermi and Coriolis coupling parameters. Intensities of the two H232S triads were modeled with rms values of 2.5%, using the transformed transition moment expansion with 19 terms for 568 intensities of the first triad and 11 terms for the 526 intensities of the second triad. The second derivatives of the dipole moment with respect to normal coordinates were estimated in Debye to be: 22$\mu$x = -0.004873 (90); 12$\mu$x = 0.01372 (30); and 23$\mu$z 0.01578 (30). This confirmed that for hydrogen sulfide some of the second derivatives are larger than the first derivatives. The calculated line intensities were summed yielding integrated band strengths (in cm-2/atm at 296 K) as follows: 0.3315 for 2$\nu$2, 0.4522 for V1, 0.1201 for $\nu$3, 0.0303 for 3$\nu$2, 1.820 for $\nu$1 + $\nu$2, and 2.869 for $\nu$2 + $\nu$3. In addition, the hot band transitions were identified in both regions. Finally, a composite database of hydrogen sulfide line parameters was predicted for the 5- to 2.5-$\mu$m region, {\textcopyright} 1998 Academic Press.},

In analogy with the stretching modes in CO2, the N-C-O sym. stretch ($\nu$3) Raman fundamental in HNCO is strong while the antisym. stretch ($\nu$2) is weak, although neither is symmetry forbidden. Both vibrational states are strongly perturbed. The sym. stretch interacts with combination states that contain two quanta of bending excitation, and the antisym. stretch interacts with several different combination states. Both Raman spectra have strong QQ branch rotational structure in which the band origins for different K sublevels in this near-prolate sym. top follow no simple pattern. Photodissocn. of the vibrationally excited states demonstrates the influence of the initial state prepn. on the rotational resonances, photofragment appearance thresholds, and Franck-Condon factors in the transition to a dissociative excited electronic state.

abstract = {Nitric acid (HNO3) plays an important role in the Earth's atmosphere as a reservoir molecule of NOx species. It has a strong infrared signature at 11$\mu$m which is one of the most commonly used for the infrared retrieval of this species in the atmosphere since this spectral region coincides with an atmospheric window. It is therefore essential to have high quality spectral parameters in this spectral region. The main goal of this work is then to generate as reliable as possible line positions and intensities for the $\nu$5 and 2$\nu$9 cold bands centered at 879.1075 and 896.4467cm-1, respectively. In particular the existing line parameters need improvement in the wings of the 11$\mu$m window in order to retrieve more accurately the CFC-11 (CCl3F) and CFC-12 (CCl 2F2) atmospheric species at _850 and _920cm -1, respectively. This work is also motivated by theoretical considerations. Very strong resonances couple indeed the 51 and 92 rotational levels. In addition the $\nu$9 mode (OH torsion) is a ""large amplitude"" motion, and torsional splittings affect both the v9=2 and the v5=1 rotational transitions. In the present study, these effects are accounted for simultaneously both for the line position and line intensity calculations. To calculate the line positions the Hamiltonian matrix accounts for the very strong Fermi and the weaker Coriolis interactions linking the 51_92 rotational levels, and the torsional effects are accounted for within the frame of the IAM (Internal Axis Method) approach. In addition, the v-diagonal blocks involve non-orthorhombic operators together with Watson's type rotational operators. This means that the z-quantization axis deviates from the a inertial axis for both the 51 and 92 vibrational states. The line intensity calculations were performed accounting also for the axis switching effects. As far as the experimental line positions are concerned we have used the millimeter wave data available in the literature [J. Mol. Spectrosc., 175 (1996) 395; J. Mol. Spectrosc., 208 (2001) 121; and references therein], as well as new centimeter wave measurements performed in Kiel and new Fourier transform infrared spectra recorded in Giessen. For the line intensities we have used an extensive set of individual line intensities measured recently [J. Mol. Spectrosc., 218 (2003) 151]. All these experimental data were very satisfactorily reproduced using the theoretical model described above and an improved set of line positions and intensities was generated for the $\nu$ 5 and 2$\nu$9 bands allowing one to better model the HNO3 absorption in the 11$\mu$m spectral domain. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Informations on these perturbing dark states were achieved through previous partial investigations of hot bands in high-resolution Fourier transform spectra recorded at 22 $\mu$m in Giessen (for 3$\nu$9- 2$\nu$9 and 3$\nu$9-$\nu$5), at 12 $\mu$m in Denver (for 3$\nu$9-$\nu$9), and at 11 $\mu$m in Orsay (for $\nu$5+$\nu$9-$\nu$9). The energy levels calculation accounts for the various Fermi, anharmonic, A-type, B-type, and C-type Coriolis resonances, which couple together the {62,9 3,41,31,5191,7 181} interacting energy levels. For nitric acid, the $\nu$9 mode (OH torsion relative to the -NO2 moiety) is a large amplitude motion. The theoretical model used in this work accounts also for large amplitude effects in the 93 dark state, which lead to a splitting of the 93 energy levels of about 0.060 cm-1. In this way, the existence of torsional splittings for several $\nu$4 perturbed lines was explained by the occurrence of local A-type and B-type Coriolis resonances coupling the 41 energy levels with those of 93. Because four dark bands had to be accounted for in the model, the results of the energy level calculations are reasonable, although not perfect.

abstract = {The infrared spectrum of the $\nu$3 vibration of the hydroperoxyl radical has been examined using a tunable lead salt diode laser. Fifty-nine transitions were observed in the wavenumber interval between 1040 and 1120 cm-1. This work extends the earlier measurements of Johns, McKellar, and Riggin to significantly higher rotational states and results in an improved set of spectroscopic constants which should predict all atmospherically relevant HO2 transition frequencies with a precision approaching a thousandth of a cm-1. The incorporation of these line positions in atmospheric transmission models using HITRAN or ATMOS data bases will be useful in remote sensing measurements of HO2. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {The $\nu$1 fundamental band of N2O is examined by a novel spectrometer that relies on the frequency locking of an external-cavity quantum cascade laser around 7.8 µm to a near-infrared Tm:based frequency comb at 1.9 µm. Due to the large tunability, nearly 70 lines in the 1240–1310 cm_1 range of the $\nu$1 band of N2O, from P(40) to R(31), are for the first time measured with an absolute frequency calibration and an uncertainty from 62 to 180 kHz, depending on the line. Accurate values of the spectroscopic constants of the upper state are derived from a fit of the line centers (rms ≈ 4.8 _ 10_6 cm_1 or 144 kHz). The $\nu$1 transitions presently measured in a Doppler regime validate high accuracy predictions based on sub-Doppler measurements of the $\nu$3 and $\nu$3-$\nu$1 transitions.},

The infrared measurements utilize a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) based difference frequency generation (DFG) source locked to the saturated absorption center of an N2O absorption line. The DFG frequency is calibrated by an optical frequency comb and an iodine hyperfine transition. We report 44 transitions ranging from J = 1 . 100 for both the P and R branches and the accuracy is better than 10 kHz for most transitions. In addition, 175 pure rotational transitions have been measured including 33 measurements with sub-Doppler precision (.3 kHz), and 142 Doppler limited measurements. These are combined with other precision rotational and vibrational measurements to provide improved quantum mechanical parameters, as well as frequency calibration tables for the N2O bands near 4.5 $\mu$m. {\textcopyright} 2014 Optical Society of America.},

abstract = {The high-resolution emission spectrum of NH has been observed in the near infrared using a Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) and a cryogenic echelle spectrograph (called Phoenix) at the National Solar Observatory at Kitt Peak. By using a large format InSb array detector, the newly constructed Phoenix is calculated to offer a large increase in sensitivity over a Fourier transform spectrometer for measurements near 5 $\mu$m (2000 cm-1). In order to test the performance of Phoenix, we recorded vibration-rotation emission spectra of the free-radical NH. The infrared bands of NH were produced in a microwave discharge of a mixture of NH3 and He. The rotational structure of five bands, 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, 4-3, and 5-4 in the 2200-3500 cm-1 region has also been measured using two FTS spectra. An analysis of these bands combined with the previous electronic, vibration-rotation, and pure rotation measurements provides improved molecular constants for the ground electronic state. In particular, we have extended the range of measured J values so that the new constants are suitable for predicting line positions in high-temperature sources such as stellar atmospheres and flames. A comparison of the Phoenix spectra with the FTS spectra confirms the higher sensitivity of the Phoenix spectrometer. The relative advantages and disadvantages of instruments like Phoenix are discussed. Although designed for astronomical work, cryogenic echelle spectrographs have applications in the ultrasensitive detection of molecules in chemical physics. {\textcopyright} 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Fourier transform infrared spectra of the inversion-rotation transitions have been measured with 0.010-cm-1 resolution between 40 and 300 cm-1 in the ground state and $\nu$2 excited states of 14NH3. Submillimeterwave spectra of the inversion and inversion-rotation transitions in the $\nu$2 state of 14NH3, including a few $\Delta$k = ±3 ""perturbation-allowed"" transitions, have been measured with microwave accuracy between 540 and 770 GHz. A simultaneous least-squares analysis of these data, the microwave ground-state transition frequencies, and the $\nu$2 infrared-microwave two-photon transition frequencies has been carried out. A theory of the $\Delta$k = ±3n interactions in the ground and $\nu$2 excited states of ammonia (S. P. Belov, L. I. Gershtein, A. F. Krupnov, A. V. Maslovskij, {\v{S}}. Urban, V. {\v{S}}pirko, and D.

A set of the ground- and $\nu$2-state molecular parameters has been obtained which describes the experimental data within the precision of the experiment. The ""smoothed"" values of transition frequencies can be used for calibration purposes with a precision better than 3 _ 10-5 cm-1 in the submillimeterwave region, better than 10-3 cm-1 in the far-infrared region, and better than 1.5 _ 10-3 cm-1 in the region 700 - 1200 cm-1. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

Tentative assignments involving 22 upper state levels of 4$\nu$2s were identified, but these were not included in the modeling at the present stage. The theoretical model and the set of programs developed for treating the infrared system $\nu$1/$\nu$3/2$\nu$4 of ammonia are briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 1999 Academic Press.},

abstract = {The $\nu$1 band of thiazyl chloride (NSCl) has been measured by high resolution FTIR spectroscopy, and studied using the spectral analysis by subtraction of simulated intensities (SASSI)-technique. This involves assignment and fitting of a component, creating a global simulation of the entire component to be subtracted from the experimental spectrum, and subsequent analysis of the resultant spectrum. Through this iterative procedure it has been possible to assign rovibrational transitions for seven components, with populations in the lower vibrational state as low as 2% of the total. The components are the 101 fundamental and 101 311, 101 322, and 101 211 hotbands of 14N32S35Cl, the 101 fundamental and 101 311 hotband of 14N32S37Cl, and the 101 fundamental of 14N34S35Cl. Rotational and centrifugal distortion constants beyond the quartic level have been obtained by fitting to Watson's A-reduced Hamiltonian in upper and lower states. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Thanks to recent high-resolution Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and pure rotational (RF/CM/MMW) measurements, several experimental values of the rotation-vibration parameters of the oblate molecule PF3 have been extracted, contributing thus to the knowledge of the molecular potential of phosphorus trifluoride. The data used are those of the fundamental, overtone and combination bands studied in the 300-1500 cm-1 range. The new values are in good agreement with ones determined at low resolution, but significantly more accurate. The agreement is excellent with the available values determined by ab initio HF-SCF calculations employing the TZP/TZ2P triple-zeta basis. From the recent experimental rovibrational interaction constants $\alpha$C and $\alpha$B, new accurate equilibrium rotational constants Ce and Be have been derived for the symmetric top molecule PF3, which were used to derive the equilibrium geometry of this molecule: re(F-P) = 1.560986 (43) {\AA}; $\theta$e(FPF) = 97.566657 (64)°.},

abstract = {The infrared vibration - rotation bands of ND in the _3$\Sigma$- state were recorded using a Fourier transform spectrometer. The bands were observed in a microwave discharge of a mixture of N2 and D2 in the presence of He. The rotational structure of six bands, 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, 4-3, 5-4, and 6-5, has been observed in the 1800-2600 cm-1 region. The analysis of these bands provides an independent determination of the ground state vibrational constants in addition to an improved set of rotational constants.

abstract = {Abstract The fundamental vibrational bending mode $\nu$2 of disulfur monoxide, S2O, and the associated hot band 2$\nu$2-$\nu$2 have been observed at high spectral resolution for the first time at the SOLEIL synchrotron facility using Fourier-transform far-infrared spectroscopy. This transient species has been produced in a radio-frequency discharge by flowing SO2 over elemental sulfur. The spectroscopic analysis has been performed using the newly developed Automated Spectral Assignment Procedure (ASAP) which has enabled the accurate determination of more than 3500 energy levels of the v2=1and2 vibrational states. The procedure provides a fast and convenient way to analyze large data sets in a straightforward manner, if one of the two vibrational states involved in the transition is accurately known from prior work. In addition to the high-resolution synchrotron study, pure rotational spectra of S2O in the v2=1 and 2 vibrational states were observed in the frequency range 250-500 GHz by absorption spectroscopy in a long-path absorption cell. From these combined measurements, extensive molecular parameter sets have been determined, including full sets of sextic and two octic centrifugal distortion terms. Highly accurate band centers (to better than 10-5 cm-1) have been derived for both vibrational bands.},

abstract = {The rotational spectra of 32S35Cl2, 32S35Cl37Cl, 32S37Cl2, and 34S35Cl2 in their ground vibrational states, as well as those of 32S35Cl2 and 32S35Cl37Cl in their v2 and 2v2 excited states, have been studied in selected frequency regions between 100 and 370 GHz. Transitions involving a large range of quantum numbers have been observed, so that precise rotational and quartic centrifugal distortion constants could be determined for each of the spectra investigated. The complete set of sextic distortion constants was also obtained for the most abundant isotopomer in its ground vibrational state. The newly determined rotational constants of 34S35Cl2 and 32S37Cl2 allowed us to calculate the complete rsstructure of sulfur dichloride using both single- and double-isotopic substitution methods. The quadratic force field has been refined using a larger set of quartic distortion constants and inertial defects. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {The infrared emission spectrum of SH has been observed in the 1850-2800 cm-1 spectral region using a Fourier transform spectrometer. The molecules were excited in a microwave discharge source and the spectra have been recorded at a resolution of 0.005 cm-1. The observed spectra consist of 1-0, 2-1, and 3-2 vibration-rotation bands of the X2 $\Pi$1/2 spin component and 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, and 4-3 bands of the X2 $\Pi$3/2 spin component. The present data were combined with the previous vibration-rotation, pure rotation, and $\Lambda$-doubling measurements in the ground state to yield an improved set of molecular constants. The principal equilibrium constants obtained from this work are: $\omega$e = 2696.2475(58) cm-1, $\omega$exe = 48.7420(28) cm-1, Be = 9.600247(51) cm-1, $\alpha$e = 0.27990(10) cm-1, and re = 1.340614(4) {\AA}. {\textcopyright} 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {The ($\nu$4 + $\nu$6) - $\nu$4, ($\nu$4 + $\nu$8) - $\nu$4 and ($\nu$4 + $\nu$9) - $\nu$4 hot infrared systems of disilane (Si 2H6) have been analysed at high resolution, and the values of the relative vibration-rotation-torsion parameters have been determined. The torsional splitting is about 0.500 cm-1 in the $\nu$4 and $\nu$4 + $\nu$6 states, and decreases strongly in the vibrationally degenerate upper states $\nu$4 + $\nu$8 (about 0.0272 cm-1 on average) and $\nu$4 + $\nu$9 (about 0.3019 cm-1), consistent with theoretical predictions. Comparison between the vibrational wavenumbers of cold transitions and hot transitions originating in the excited torsional state v4 = 1 allows one to determine the change of the fundamental torsional frequency $\nu$4 caused by the excitation of small amplitude vibrations. A remarkable increase in $\nu$4 of about 8.599 cm-1 is found in the v4 = 1 state (E1d SiH3d-rocking mode, asymmetric to inversion in the staggered geometry), and this corresponds to an increase in the torsional barrier height in this excited fundamental vibrational state by about 48.77 cm-1. The mechanism responsible for the decrease of the torsional splittings in the degenerate vibrational states is briefly outlined by means of second-order perturbation theory, using torsion-hindered vibrational basis functions of E1d and E 2d symmetries for the degenerate modes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.},

abstract = {The high-resolution infra-red spectrum of SiH4 in the region 2101 cm–1 to 2265 cm–1 has been analysed. Most of the lines observed have been assigned to transitions of the $\nu$3 and $\nu$1 bands of the abundant isotopic species28SiH4. The $\nu$1 band is formally forbidden in the infra-red, but a vibrationrotation interaction between $\nu$1 and $\nu$3 lends intensity to the $\nu$1 transitions. The spectrum has been fitted by diagonalizing the v3 = 1 and v1 = 1 hamiltonians coupled by the vibration-rotation interaction term. 500 transitions have been fitted with an overall standard deviation of 0_007 cm–1, using only 15 adjustable parameters (ten in the v3 = 1 hamiltonian, four in the v1 = 1 hamiltonian, and one interaction coefficient). The calculated intensities are also in good agreement with experiment. Transitions of the other isotopic species29SiH4 and30SiH4 have also been observed, but these spectra have not been analysed in detail. {\textcopyright} 1978 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The present paper deals with the analysis of the microwave, millimeter-wave, and infrared spectra of 28SiHF3 in its ground, $\nu$6 = 1 and $\nu$4 = 1 excited states. The former was observed up to 1055 GHz leading to the determination of one octic centrifugal distortion constant, LJ = -0.0749(55) $\mu$Hz. Furthermore the _k|H|k ± 6_ interaction term |h3,GS| = 1.1032(70) mHz has been fitted from splittings of six K = 3 lines. The excited states have been regarded as isolated ones. This enabled fits according the Q-, D-, and QD-reduction schemes proposed by E. I. Lobodenko, O. N. Sulakshina, V. I. Perevalov, and Vl. G. Tyuterev, (J. Mol. Spectrosc. 126, 159-170 (1987)) and further developed by J. K. G. Watson, C. Gerke, H. Harder, and K. Sarka, (J. Mol. Spectrosc. 187, 131-141 (1997)) and Harder (J. Mol. Spectrosc. 194, 145 (1999)). A multiple fit analysis was performed confirming the assumption that the excited states are not affected by intervibrational resonances. Finally the millimeter spectrum of 29SiHF3 and 30SiHF3 in their ground state was also measured up to 460 GHz and accurate rotational and centrifugal distortion parameters were derived. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {In methylene, the rotational levels of the {\~{a}} 1A 1 (0,0,0) and (0,1,0) vibronic states are so heavily perturbed by nearby rovibrational levels of the ground triplet state (__ 3B1) that standard rotation-vibration Hamiltonians do not provide a satisfactory fit or any indication as to which levels are strongly perturbed and which are less perturbed. Recent spectroscopic and theoretical work gives triplet state term values and the singlet-triplet energy difference with an accuracy of a few tens of wave numbers. Using these term values and ab initio spin-orbit matrix lements it is shown that all Ka=1, 3, and 4 levels of 1A1 (0,0,0) and all Ka=1 levels of 1A1 (0,1,0) are strongly perturbed by 3B 1 (0,$\upsilon$2,0) levels with 2≤$\upsilon$2≤4. Individual levels in the other Ka stacks are also perturbed but most can be fit satisfactorily with a Watson Hamiltonian. The shifts between the observed term values and those calculated from the Watson Hamiltonian are reproduced in each Ka stack by a spin-orbit matrix element value only 5%-30% larger than the ab initio value. Over 60% of the measured term values show shifts greater than 0.2 cm-1. Shifts of the 322 and 000 levels can only be explained by interaction with levels in either (1,0,0) or (0,0,1) states; possible values for the vibrational frequencies of $\nu$1 and $\nu$3 of 3B1 are given. Molecular constants for 1A1 (0,0,0) and (0,1,0) are derived and quantitative estimates of spin-orbit mixing for individual levels of 1A1 (0,0,0) and (0,1,0) are given. From a chemical point of view singlet methylene is never in a pure spin state and always has some triplet character in its wave function. These data provide a basis for proper modeling of the kinetics of chemical reactions of ""singlet"" and ""triplet"" methylene species and their interconversion by ""intersystem crossing."" {\textcopyright} 1987 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The symmetric and antisymmetric stretch spectra of {\~{a}} 1A1 CH2 are measured with Doppler-limited resolution by infrared flash-kinetic spectroscopy between 2600 and 3050 cm -1. The spectra are significantly perturbed by spin-orbit interactions between near-resonant levels of __ 3B1 in both lower and upper levels of the transitions, and by Coriolis interaction between symmetric and antisymmetric stretch states. The triplet character of the perturbed levels is detected by observing broadening of MJ structure in a magnetic field of about 1 kG. The levels that are likely to be perturbed by triplet methylene are identified using the experimentally observed and theoretically calculated 3B1 energy level structure. The term values of the remaining symmetric and antisymmetric stretch levels are simultaneously fit to Watson's Hamiltonian including Coriolis coupling. This analysis provides the remaining information needed to determine the equilibrium rotational constants [Ae = 19.8054(206), Be = 11.2489(45), and Ce = 7.2386(36) cm-1], and, therefore, the equilibrium structure (re = 1.107 {\AA}, and $\theta$e = 102.4°) of this fundamentally important carbene.

Splittings of some of the levels are observed and the splitting constant for K = 3 of the ground state is determined for the first time. Other observed splittings include the K = 1 levels of 2v3 (l = 2), the K = 2 levels of v3 and v4, and the K = 3 levels of v2. The analysis shows that there are level crossings between the l = 0 and l = 2 states of 2v3 that allow one to determine the separation of the subband centers for these two states even though access to the l = 0 state from the ground state is electric-dipole forbidden. This is a generalized phenomenon that should be found for many other molecules with the same symmetry.

abstract = {The $\nu$2 (bending) fundamental band of CH2 in its __ 3B1 ground electronic state has been studied using tunable diode laser spectroscopy and also the LMR (laser magnetic resonance) technique in the 800-911 cm-1 and 1030-1173 cm-1 regions. For the diode laser study, a multiple-traversal absorption cell was used with Zeeman modulation, and the CH2 radicals were produced by a mild discharge in a flowing mixture of ketene (_0.3 Torr) and helium (_2 Torr). Under these conditions, the apparent lifetime of CH2 following cutoff of the discharge was about 1 ms. A total of 53 new transitions with rotational quantum numbers up to N=10, K_a=3, and K_a=2 were observed to add to the 11 transitions previously measured in this band. A combined analysis of the present data and all the previous pure rotational and $\nu$2 band results on CH2 has yielded an improved set of molecular parameters, including the first determination of centrifugal distortion effects for the dominant spin-spin interaction parameter, D. The present data have also been used in a comprehensive new analysis of triplet methylene rotation-vibration energies using the nonrigid bender Hamiltonian by Bunker et al. in an accompanying paper. {\textcopyright} 1986 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The Morse oscillator-rigid bender internal dynamics (MORBID) Hamiltonian [P. Jensen, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 128, 478 (1988) ] has been used in a fitting to all extant rotation-vibration data for __3B1 methylene CH2. This fitting leads to an improved determination of the potential energy surface, and in particular to reliable predictions for the stretching frequencies. We predict v1 = 2992 cm-1 and v3 = 3213 cm-1 for 12CH2, and we hope that the new predictions will encourage the experimental search for these weak fundamentals. In the MORBID approach the rotation-vibration energies are obtained from the potential energy surface in a purely variational calculation, and consequently the present work is an improvement over previous determinations of the CH2 potential energy surface from experiment that used the nonrigid bender formalism [see P. R. Bunker et al., J. Chem. Phys. 85, 3724 (1986), and references therein]; this latter approach treats the stretching vibrations by second order perturbation theory. A fitting to the J = 0 vibrational energy data for {\~{a}}1A1 methylene has also been made here using the MORBID Hamiltonian. Combining the results of these MORBID fittings to experimental data for the (X_) and ({\~{a}}) states of CH2 we obtain the singlet-triplet splittings T0({\~{a}} 1A1) = 3147 cm-1 (8.998 kcal/mol) and T e ({\~{a}} 1A1) = 3223 cm-1 (9.215 kcal/ mol). {\textcopyright} 1988 American Institute of Physics.},
